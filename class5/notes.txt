Network Capture
---------------
Class #5 - capture e.g. google.com by hijacking DNS

Edit /etc/hosts on linuxlabs-gw

127.0.0.1  google.com

$ sudo systemctl reload dnsmasq  # force dnsmasq to reload config files

Now all attempts to get to google.com are captured by the gateway.
Extra credit if you run a local webserver and capture it there.
