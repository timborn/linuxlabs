If you don't have a service in mind to play with for these exercises,
you can try this one: How To Create a systemd Service in Linux (CentOS
7). 
http://linuxlabs.duckdns.org:8080/#%20https%3A%2F%2Fscottlinux.com%2F2014%2F12%2F08%2Fhow-to-create-a-systemd-service-in-linux-centos-7%2F 
While it's actually more than the exercise calls for, you get to see
how to create the unit for and "wrap" an existing tool so it becomes a
well-formed service.
