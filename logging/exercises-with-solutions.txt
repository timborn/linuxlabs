1. Use logger(1) to send log msgs from a shell script to system log

logger "this is some error msg"

2. Use facility = user

logger -p user ...

2a. Send a msg w/ level “warning”; check the logs

logger -p user.warning WARNING

2b. Send a msg w/ level “debug”; check the logs

logger -p user.debug DEBUG

3. Explain & fix

DEBUG level isn't being logged, but WARNING level is.
This is controlled by /etc/rsyslog.conf

grep -v ^$ /etc/rsyslog.conf | grep -v ^#

The line that is filtering out DEBUG messages is this one:
*.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages

4. What is the order (precedence) of logging levels?

(from logger(1)):

Valid level names are:

              emerg	<-- highest priority
              alert
              crit
              err
              warning
              notice
              info
              debug	<-- lowest priority


-------

1. Configure rsyslog to send *all* msgs from facility ‘local0’ to 
   a special log file 

# /etc/rsyslog.conf:
> # my special logfile
> local0.*	/var/log/tims-log

sudo systemctl restart rsyslog

2. Test it

logger -p local0.warn WARN-WARN-WARN

sudo cat /var/log/tims-log

# NB to really test it, send in DEBUG and confirm, since DEBUG is filtered
