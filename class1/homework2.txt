greetings - 

You have more reading _before_ class #2.  We have two topics in mind:

1. User Management
- RHEL7 System Administrator's Guide, ch. 4, Managing Users and Groups
- Sudo, ibid ch. 6

2. Service Management
RHEL7 System Administrator's Guide - ch 10, systems

RHEL7 System Administrator's Guide (pdf):

To spur your creative juices for ideas for your FINAL PROJECT, have a look
at MagPi, a magazine about Raspberry Pis.  There are more than 75 issues
freely available on line.  Here's a link to one:
