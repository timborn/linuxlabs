BEFORE class 1 

Greetings all –
 
YOU ARE COHORT #5 (“early risers”) WHICH MEETS EVERY Tuesday FROM 0630-0830 starting 1/29/19
 
The rules of the road for the Linux class are:
1.       These classes are done on your own time, out of whatever your normal hours are.
2.       The class runs for six weeks, two hours of class each week, with reading and other homework.
3.       Technically for FTE only.  If you have questions, just see me.  We can probably work something out.
4.       Personal laptop would be very helpful.  Our first lesson involves building our Raspberry Pi and then making it usable without a monitor and keyboard (“headless”), so a personal laptop is useful to confirm when you have ssh & VNC running correctly.
5.       Qualifications and sign up here: https://confluence.uk.jpmorgan.com/confluence/display/SMOKEJUMPERS/Linux+Raspberry+Pi
 
TODO:
1.       As we will be doing most of this out of hours off corp network, if you are up for it, sharing your personal email address would help.
2.       There is HOMEWORK before you even show up.  Required pre-reading.
a.       read "Understanding bash: Elements of Programming", Linux Journal 
 https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/understanding-bash-elements-programming
b.      Get a copy of Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide for use as a reference
