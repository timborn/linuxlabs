We left off a little bit of the service management homework, and I
suggested that there was a slightly more elaborate but rewarding
exercise - converting a package into a service so it behaves well
on your system.  On the wiki, under Service Management Exercises:

If you don't have a service in mind to play with for these exercises,
you can try this one: How To Create a systemd Service in Linux
(CentOS 7). While it's actually more than the exercise calls for,
you get to see how to create the unit for and "wrap" an existing
tool so it becomes a well-formed service.
